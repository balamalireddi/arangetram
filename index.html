							<p><h2><strong>Bharatanatyam</strong></h2>
							Bharatanatyam first originated in southern India in the state of Tamilnadu. Starting as a temple dance 2000 years ago, it has developed into the most progressive dance form of all the Indian classical dance forms. The name Bharatanatyam represents the four most important facets of dance in Sanskrit. "Bha" meaning emotion, "Ra" meaning melody, "ta" meaning rhythm and "natyam" meaning dance.</p>

							<p><h2><strong>Arangetram</strong></h2>
							Arangetram is the debut on-stage performance of a classical art student, after taking years of training. It is a graduation dance attended by many people for any art form. The word arangetram originated from the Tamil language and means ascending the stage by an artist on the completion of his/her training.</p>

								<h2>Program</h2>
							</header>

							<p>
							<h2><strong>Ganesha (Ganapati) Kauthuvam</strong></h2>
							Ganesha Kauthuvam is a invocatory dance where the dancer offers prayers to Lord Ganesha and seeks his blessings to make the event a success. The rhythmic syllables are woven with words in praise of Lord Ganesha. In this dance, Ganesha is described as the one who removes all obstacles and praised and adored by all the Devas and Ghanas.<br> 
							Raaga: Nattai, Taala: Aadi
							</p>
							<p>
							<h2><strong>Alaripu</strong></h2>
							Literally meaning 'a blooming flower', Alaripu is the first dance that is taught to a Bharatanatyam student. It is designed to give the effect of the body unfolding itself by degrees. During the dance, the movements of the dancer are shown in all three tempos, or kaalam as she goes from slow to fast. This dance requires much sharpness and preciseness and is known as the most challenging dance to perfect.<br> 
							Raaga: Nattai, Taala: Tishra Ekam
							</p>
							<p>
							<h2><strong>Jathiswaram</strong></h2>
							Jathiswaram is a combination of two words: “jati” meaning beat, and “swaram” meaning musical notes. It is a difficult item of pure dance (nritta) in which the dancer goes through several movements on a basic musical composition. Abhinaya (expressions) are not shown in this dance.<br> 
							Raaga: Kalyani, Taala: Roopaka
							</p>
							<p>
							<h2><strong>Shabdam</strong></h2>
							Shabdam is the first dance where abhinaya or facial expression is use to depict a story. The dancer tries to narrate a story using meaningful hand gestures, eye movements, and expressions. This Shabdam is about the pranks and mischief of the young Krishna. In the first part, Krishna described as the cowherd who is nowhere to be found. He is busy teasing the beautiful gopikas( milkmaids) and sneaking around to steal butter. In the second part, Krishna is represented as the one who has lovely curly hair with ruby red lips. In the third part, he is shown as the one with beautiful lotus eyes and beautiful decoration on his forehead. Finally, Krishna is seen as the one who dances on the serpent in the water. He is the one who the gopikas adorn themselves and run out to meet him. Inspite of all his pranks, he is still the lord and the one who rescues us.<br>
							Raaga: Raagamaalika, Taala: Mishra Chapu
							</p>
							<p>
							<h2><strong>Varnam</strong></h2>
							The main item of the Bharatanatyam recital is the varnam. The dance alternates between passages of nritta and nritya, balancing pure dance and expressive dance, and combining both in the final movements. The nayika or the heroine of the dance Parvathi  is talking to the hero, her husband, Shiva , saying, ”Won't you listen to me, my beautiful swami, my majestic lord…I weave garlands for you, I give you everything I have, I write letters to you and yet you ignore me.She addresses him as the Lord of Tanja, Shri Brihadeeshwara. He is the one who receives Ganga in his hair, the one with the fierce snake and the gentle moon and the one who wears the tiger's skin around him.The half of varnam is marked by muktaya swara and the sarpa nadai. Here The nayika says, you are so beautiful, so majestic. Now I drown in this ocean of love and am floating lifelessly.
							The second half of varnam marks a change in mood, tempo and speed. The Nayika demands, why are you angry with me. Earlier we would talk, we would listen to each other, now you ignore me. Swami, a king of your equal stature I have not seen anywhere.When cupid's 5 arrows piece my heart, why do sneak away at this time. You are the king of kings, everyone signs your parise, you are the giver of boons and you take away all sorrows. With love won't you take me with you?<br>
							Raaga: Shankarabharanam Taala: Aadi
